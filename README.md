This repository documents an artistic research project that used a deep learning model to encode data produced from the bodies of performers for the purposes of sonification, visualization and curiosity. 

This research was conducted during rehearsals for _Dancing at the Edge of the World_, a speculative performance piece directed by Diana Neranti and supported by [The Volkswagen Foundation](https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/).

The data streams are generated through movement using a system designed by [Mika Satomi](http://www.nerding.at/cv/). More information about these suits can be found [here]().

This repository contains code to train, run and evaluate the deep neural network model used.

The repository [DatEdgeProxy](https://github.com/meredityman/DatEdgeProxy) contains code to run an installation interactively.

# Introduction

## Motivation

It is often hard to process physiological signals computationally a way that we would like. This is because such data tend to come pretty dirty, in terms of the amount of noise, and variation between sessions, individuals and sensor placement.

We would like to extract more human relatable properties from that data, such as tempo, tone, body position or type of movement. We hope to infer these 'high level' properties of movement from 'low level' measures of resistance in conductive fabrics.

If we attempted to directly 

Its hard to sonify movement data.

In summary, data of this kind are messy.

Supervised/Unsupervised

Semantic/ Edge of abstraction.

"Measurable results are not the only results"


## Research Questions

1. What gestural information from the suits can be captured, understood and modelled.
2. Can realtime sonification be used to communicate the patterns to an audience.
3. Measuring syncronicities.



## Technical Discussion

Dimensionality reduction, or compression

In live settings we can spawn new models from the 'meta-encoder'
